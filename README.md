# codeigniter3 test
Test for a job interview

Author: Alberto Nebot Oliva
Reviewer: Chlo√© Fournier

This test took me about 3 hours to complete.

Requirements:

Develop a CodeIgniter 3 to register user
Show the users in a list
Delete users

You can find the database table in /public/subscriptions.sql

database name: test
database table: subscriptions

Remember to change the database configuration on your local installation of codeigniter in:
/application/config/database.php

I understand that I could have done some things better, like ajax updates of the list using jQuery, better styles, etc... but it's not the purpose of this test. 

The main focus of this test is showing the competences in the use of the framework and the understanding of the modular/reusable patterns.
